<p>Hey <%= @resource.email %>!</p>

<p>Apparently, someone has requested a link to change your password. It's below.</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Change my password', edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token) %></p>

<p>If you didn't request this, there are shenanigans.</p>
<p>Your password won't change until you use the link above and create a new one.</p>
